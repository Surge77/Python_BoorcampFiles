1.What is the difference between a for loop and a while loop?
2.What is the purpose of range() function with an example?
3.What is the purpose of break statement in python?
4.What is the purpose of continue statement in python?
5.What is the purpose of pass statement in python?

1. -> for loop is used when the number of iterations is known whereas a while loop is used when the number of iterations
      are unknown

2. -> The range() function in Python is used to generate a sequence of numbers, typically used in for loops
      start: (optional): The starting number of the sequence. Defaults to 0.
      stop: (required): The end number of the sequence. The sequence will go up to, but not including, this number.
      step: (optional): The increment between each number in the sequence. Defaults to 1.

3. ->In Python, break allows you to exit a loop when an external condition is met. Normal program execution resumes at
      the next statement. You can use a break statement with both for loops and while loops

4. ->The continue statement in Python is used to skip the remaining code inside a loop for the current iteration only.

5. ->The pass statement is used as a placeholder for future code. When the pass statement is executed, nothing happens,
     but you avoid getting an error when empty code is not allowed. Empty code is not allowed in loops, function
      definitions, class definitions, or in if statements.
