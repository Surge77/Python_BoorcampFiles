Break statement:

The break statement is used to terminate the execution of the nearest enclosing loop in which it appears.The break
statement is widely used with for loop and while loop.When compiler encounters a break statement the control passes to
the statement that follows the loop in which the break statement appears

Continue statement:

Like the break statement,the continue statement can only appear in the body of a loop.When the compiler encounters a
continue statement,then the rest of the statements in the loop are skipped and the control is unconditionally
transferred to the loop continuation portion of the nearest enclosing loop

Pass statement:

The pass statement is used when a statement is required syntactically but no command or code has to be executed.It
specifies a null operation or simply No operation (NOP) statement.Nothing happens when the pass statement is executed.
